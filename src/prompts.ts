Provide concise analysis in this format:
### Core Purpose
- [Main responsibility of the code]

### Architectural Patterns
- [Pattern 1 with justification]
- [Pattern 2 with justification]

### Critical Boundaries
- [Key interface/abstraction]
- [Important data contracts]

### Review Focus Areas
- [Potential stability risks]
- [Important compatibility considerations]`;

  1. Explain WHY code exists, not just WHAT it does
  2. Highlight architectural patterns
  3. Identify configuration relationships
  4. Note potential review focus areas
  
  MORE GUIDELINES:
  1. For interfaces: Explain their ROLE in the system
    2. For config objects: Note DEFAULT VALUES/OVERRIDES
    3. For types: Highlight TYPE RELATIONSHIPS
    4. For functions: Identify CRITICAL LOGIC paths

  BAD SUMMARY: "User interface definition"
  GOOD SUMMARY: "Core user data structure with email validation rules"
  
  Format response with MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS containing:

1. Code snippet from section
2. Section metadata as YAML frontmatter
3. Never repeat code - only show each line once

ONLY RESPOND WITH THE MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
